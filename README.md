# DEXTER

DEXTER is a research project designed to discover and extraction product specifications on the Web.

In this repository you can find the output dataset generated by DEXTER, the dataset if organized as follows:
* Output XML: dump with all the attribute/value pairs collected
* URLs of product pages: list of product URLs build by DEXTER | TODO
* Pages dump: a dump of the processed pages | TODO 


### Output XML:

We provide under output-xml a dump of the specifications of the discovered products. Each file is a compressed (.7z) file that contains an XML dump with all the discovered products for a specific category.

The XML dump follows this structure:
```xml
<products>
	<product>
		<site>www.amazon.com</site>
		<category>camera</category>
		<url>http://www.amazon.com/...</url>
		<attribute_1>value_attribute_1</attribute_1>
		...
	</product>
	<product>
		...
	</product>
	...
</products>
``` 

To each product we have added three additional attributes: URL from which the specification has been extracted, the category associated to the page and the website.
